# Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Software-Development-Using-Jenkins

Developed and implemented an automated continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline the software development, testing, and deployment process.

- Set up Jenkins as the CI/CD orchestrator to automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline.
- Integrated SonarQube for continuous code quality analysis and static code inspection.
- Created Docker images for containerized deployment and pushed them to Docker Hub for easy access.
- Deployed Docker images on Amazon EC2 instances for scalable and reliable hosting.
- Configured Jenkins to trigger builds and deployments automatically upon code changes, ensuring rapid feedback and timely releases.


## Skills and Technologies Used:
- Jenkins
- SonarQube
- Docker
- Docker Hub
- Amazon EC2
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Automated Deployment
- Testing
- Image Creation
- Code Quality

## Project Outcome:
- Accelerated the software development and deployment process, resulting in faster time-to-market.
- Improved code quality and reduced defects through continuous code analysis and testing.
- Streamlined the deployment process, eliminating manual steps and reducing the risk of errors.
- Enhanced collaboration and productivity among development, QA, and operations teams by providing a centralized platform for tracking and monitoring the CI/CD pipeline.
